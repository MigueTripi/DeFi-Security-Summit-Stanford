Welcome to Challenge 1!

This file contains the challege's Exploit contract which you will have to complete.

=====================================================================

Secureum has raised a lot of Ether and decided to buy a bunch of 
`InSecureumToken`s ($ISEC) in order to make them available to the community
via flash loans. This is made possible by means of the `InSecureumLenderPool`
contract.

ðŸ“Œ Upon deployment, the `InSecureumToken` contract mints an initial
supply of 10 **$ISEC** to the contract deployer.

ðŸ“Œ The `InSecureumLenderPool` contract operates with $ISEC.

ðŸ“Œ The contract deployer transfers all of their $ISEC to the
`InSecureumLenderPool` contract.

ðŸ“Œ The idea is that anyone can deposit $ISECs to enlarge the pool's resources.

Will you be able to steal the $ISECs from the `InSecureumLenderPool`? ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
