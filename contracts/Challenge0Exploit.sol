Welcome to Challenge 0!

This file contains the challege's Exploit contract which you will have to complete.

=====================================================================

Let's begin with a simple warm up.
Our beloved Vitalik is the proud owner of 100 $VTLK,
which is a token that follows the ERC20 token standard.
Or at least that is what it seems... ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ“Œ Upon deployment, the `VToken` contract mints 100 $VTLK to Vitalik's address.

Is there a way for you to **steal** those tokens from him? ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
